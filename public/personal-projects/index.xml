      <description>Design Challenge I&amp;rsquo;m a big foodie and I often add restaurant reviews to Google Maps to keep track of places I visit and help other English speakers in Tokyo (I also think it&amp;rsquo;s a great app :)
When uploading to Google Maps, the user can add a caption, however if your photos are upside down, under exposed or need cropping, then you have to open a different app to do any photo editing.</description>

      <description>Design Challenge UGC (user-generated content) is enriching Google Maps from just a route planner before, now the app can be your guide to doing things. On the surface, looking at the rating and reading reviews can often be enough to make a yes-no decision about eating in a restaurant, drinking in a bar or entering a venue. I decided to focus on restaurants for this challenge and make the UGC more granular by quickly showing a succession of rating categories for food, service and value in addition to the overall rating.</description>

      <title>Angle adjust</title>

      <description>Design Challenge I love snowboarding and wanted to capture the best footage from a day in the mountains. However, after challenging the limits of my ability, I eventually wipe out, knocking my Go Pro off angle. I decided to create a smartwatch app which enables the user to quickly check what they&amp;rsquo;re shooting and change the angle without having to pull out a phone or guess.

      <description>Design Challenge I sometimes find the Quora app quite useful for looking up specific questions. I noticed both the header/footer nav were always present and reduced screen real estate when quickly browsing long pages. My solution was to prototype a retractable header/footer nav when an on scroll event is detected. Once the user finds something of interest and stops the page scroll, the header/footer nav reappear.

      <title>Modular carousel</title>

      <description>Design Challenge Framer has been my go-to tool for interactive prototypes, however, sometimes it takes a crazy amount of code to put together an experience consisting of just a few components. My solution was to create a modular JS carousel component which could be easily reused across different projects and customized with a few variables.
Design Process  Think of a component you often use Write out what the component should do (Pseudocode if you prefer) Write your component straight into Framer (it&amp;rsquo;s much faster this way) Once your code is working, move it to a .</description>

      <description>Design Challenge I enjoy using Instagram, but one of my pet peeves is that you can&amp;rsquo;t (at the time of writing 2016/4/5) quickly swipe through full-screen photos. My solution was to quickly prototype a lightbox modal which chronological queues up photos so the user can swipe through each photo and return by swiping up.
