&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaps was preparing for its IPO and required a rebranding overhaul of its flagship site. The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and deliver one integrated brand experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideation&#34;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site. We also carried out a heuristic analysis of the current site to identify what needed to change and why. Our KPI was to use the site to springboard marketing campaigns before the IPO and drive business leads through a contact page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iteration&#34;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a content audit and site map, I started to sketch out the five main pages: home, analytics, promotion, engagement and revenue. I took a mobile-first approach to put focus on content structure over element positioning. Wireframes were developed into simple clickable prototypes. I kept the visuals light and unobtrusive to match the dashboard&amp;rsquo;s style guide and other sites which I&amp;rsquo;d made previously. To bring a unique level of branding to the project I did a photoshoot which the dashboard on mobile devices and laptops. High level mocks were test driven with InVision and solicited for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To scale and rapidly produce the site, php partials were used for repeatable elements and Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation to do the heavy lifting. A sub nav was implemented that became fixed on scrolling to highlight your current position and provide a more intuitive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective&#34;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A/B test and try to identify if there is a statistical significance between designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To design and code a new landing page for Metaps which introduces a business model to monetize robot development. The site must be able to communicate the company&amp;rsquo;s vision through an easy-to-understand narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;design-process&#34;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the sketch for stakeholders and the design, maybe a simple user journey and some simple user reseach from Google Analytics.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;process-involvement&#34;&gt;Process &amp;amp; Involvement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wireframe + prototype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art direction + photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI design + front-end development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sketching&#34;&gt;Sketching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with all projects, I always start on paper and try to generate as many ideas as possible. Unltimately, the ideation and branching off will lead to a springboard for the wireframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wireframe&#34;&gt;Wireframe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[include image of responsive wireframe] Talk about information architecture here (one page or lack of it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;branding&#34;&gt;Branding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include the color pallet. Talk about the photograhpy you took&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;interaction&#34;&gt;Interaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A content-light landing page which required an enriched user experience right from the start of interacting with the page.
Create an on-scroll animation for the top section, which smoothly leads you to the next section of content whilst simultaneously reducing the navigation header in size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective&#34;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make consistent user research a part of your process.
There is only so much time in the day, but I always wish there was more time for customer feedback and user research. We have performed lightweight, guerrilla research at Starbucks coffee shops, remote usability sessions, and even in-person workshops with some of our current customers, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t consistent. I’m always in awe at the gold mine of information and clarity these sessions bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To design and develop a single page site with unique branding to attract app developers and other potential clients. The site had to be able to showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideation&#34;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project I was working with a new project leader. We sat down and discussed the site&amp;rsquo;s value proposition and map out key aspects of: what the site is, who are the users, and how the site will be used. We narrowed down our blueprint and created a consensus that this site should focus on unique branding to attract app developers and other potential clients. The site must be able to showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow.  Our primary KPI was to drive inquires and business leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iteration&#34;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the site assets were already in our possession, so I decided to quickly mark up some moodboards and get an overall sense and direction. The project leader has some ideas and we bounced these around and came up with two distinct designs. We tested our wireframe prototypes and moved forward with two viable designs for a high fidelity mock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leveraged Gulp with the Foundation framework and implemented the sticky nav component to achieve maximum exposure for the header on first view. I exported my custom icons from Sketch and used Icomoon to read these in with CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective&#34;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim for the most unique experience you can through custom elements and hand drawn illustration. This was one of the rare projects where original artwork was sourced and custom icons were implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaps is an app monetization platform focused on how to maximize revenue and optimize campaign performance.
This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts: the first part was to redesign the landing page – which was not I&amp;rsquo;m not going to cover in this case study.  What will be discussed in more detail, are the UI features for the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideation&#34;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project.
These kickoff meetings were focused on whiteboard sketches, followed up with a round of discussion and more importantly comprehension of each others&amp;rsquo; ideas.
After that, I would brainstorm and use other ideation techniques to evolve a series of possible solutions.
Benchmarking the competition and testing out current solutions in the market helped solve some key decisions regarding the user journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iteration&#34;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I started to develop the more viable solutions into wireframe journey maps, which would and take us to another round of discussion.
To achieve quick results, I used Invision to prototype the wireframes into a clickable user experience.
Allowing several employees to click through the experience and leave comments was invaluable to quickly iterating the design towards a final viable solution.
Once the user flow and UI had been fine tuned, I moved to Sketch to create high fidelity mocks and iron out any concerns about integration with the existing UI (built by my team mate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stage was to leverage the Foundation framework and Rails asset pipeline to build out a static views. Once the layout and sizing were pixel perfect, the focus turned to the user journey and how each action would link to the next task.
Luckily we had already tested this with our prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retropsective&#34;&gt;Retropsective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this product was in its initial stages of development, having more user data at hand could of helped with some of the decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;visit&#34;&gt;Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A careers site for Metaps to continue its growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals.
The new page had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideation&#34;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussing the CEO&amp;rsquo;s vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and worked out a stakeholders map of touchpoints of how each group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the site should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iteration&#34;&gt;Iteration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After benchmarking some other career sites, I sketched out variations on the blueprint we formulated in the ideation phase. Our conversion goal was to get the user to apply for open positions, so we decided on a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research (from &lt;a href=&#34;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highrise-marketing-site-ab-testing-part-1&#34; title=&#34;User testing from 37signals&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt;) also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic user flow prototypes were test driven. Iterating on the various designs, I solicited feedback from the team, CEO and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item.  Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions. Say no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deceiving in nature, this single page site would actually harbour most of its data in job specification partials. I turned to AngularJS to leverage and automate the application process and created a slider for the employee interviews.  I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;retropsective&#34;&gt;Retropsective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity.  The top hero image veered on a minimal &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;, and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in job descriptions was extremely convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;visit&#34;&gt;Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spike Box is a social networking app and similar in concept to Craigslist.
The brief was to design a simple and easy-to-understand UI, where users can easily share item photos with friends and followers. The app must stand out from other competitors while still creating a simple yet engaging product which aligns to the Spike branding experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideation&#34;&gt;Ideation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a native app was a first for Metaps and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any specific user data to work from. We held several meetings, with a projector to discuss planning and strategy. Once we started to define a direction another round of meetings and checkpoints were setup (it was a lengthy process!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project.
These kickoff meetings were focused on whiteboard sketches, followed up with a round of discussion and more importantly comprehension of each others&amp;rsquo; ideas.

Focus Point
Design an integrated experience where users can easily label photos under the categories; Sale, Trade, Rent or Giveaway. The UI must provide well-balanced synergy between other elements and not increase cognitive load to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus Solution
Utilize icons for globally recognized signifiers such as Comment, Like and Menu. For less afforded global signifiers (Sale, Trade, Rent, Giveaway) use simple text and colour to distinguish functionality. Group similar functions together and hierarchically order elements according to use-value importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../images/me_top_sm@2x.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hero for DirectAd project&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DirectAd was an extension of the Metaps ad platform, offering zero commission CPC. The project brief was to design and develop two separate landing pages which highlights key product features and provides appropriate call-to-action dialogue. The site must incorporate an integrated brand experience for both advertiser and publisher pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-point&#34;&gt;Focus Point&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differentiate between the publisher and advertiser pages whilst maintaining a centralised brand experience and layout that is similar in both structure and rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-solution&#34;&gt;Focus Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create two swatch palettes — the publisher UI veering towards more monochromatic tones and advertiser incorporating brighter more contrasting colours. Provide cohesion between iconography, typography, background motifs and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;visit&#34;&gt;Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
