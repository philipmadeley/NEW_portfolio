Goals Since the product was new to the market, Kao wanted to focus on two goals:
1. Create brand awareness and lift
2. Motivate the customer to buy the product</description>

Concept We had great support from Kirin&amp;rsquo;s marketing team and leveraged their user research to create an immersive page around activities associated with relaxing at home after work with a beer.</description>

      <description>-- Overview Metaps was preparing for its IPO and required a rebranding overhaul of its flagship site. The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and delivered one integrated brand experience.
Ideation Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site.</description>

      <description>Overview Spike Box is a social networking app and similar in concept to Craigslist but with followers. The brief was to design a simple and easy-to-understand UI, where users can easily share stuff that they don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore. The app must stand out from other competitors and create value for the user by being easy-to-use, yet engaging.
Ideation Developing a native app was a first for Metaps and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any firsthand user data to work from.</description>

      <description>Overview Metaps is an app monetization platform focused on how to maximize revenue and optimize campaign performance. This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts:
 Design and implement modular components for the preexisting dashboard
 Redesign the landing page
  In this case study, I will only discuss the dashboard funnel and segment analytics tools.
Ideation Kickoff meetings were held with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project.</description>

      <description>Overview To design and code a new landing page for Metaps which introduces a business model to monetize robot development. The site must be able to communicate the company&amp;rsquo;s vision through an easy-to-understand narrative.
Ideation Robot monetization was an off-tangent business for Metaps, and blue-sky thinking was required to move the project forward. A Stakeholder map and some basic storyboarding identified use-case scenarios and how the product could relate to different user groups.</description>
