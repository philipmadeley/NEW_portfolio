The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and delivered one integrated brand experience. Ideation Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site. We also carried out a heuristic analysis of the current site to identify what needed to change and why. Our KPI was to springboard a new marketing campaign before the IPO and drive business leads through a contact page. Iteration Doing a content audit we came up with a site map and good starting point for sketching. There would be five pages: home, analytics, promotion, engagement, and revenue. I took a mobile-first approach to focus on content structure over element positioning. Wireframes were developed into clickable prototypes. I kept the visuals light and unobtrusive to match the dashboard&amp;rsquo;s style guide and other products which I&amp;rsquo;d made previously. To bring a unique level of branding to the project I did a photo shoot focusing on displaying the product on laptops and mobile. High-level mocks were test driven with InVision and solicited for group feedback. Implementation To scale and rapidly produce the site, PHP partials were used for repeatable header, footer, and nav elements, then using Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation to do the heavy lifting. A sub nav was implemented that became fixed on scrolling to highlight your current position and provide a more intuitive user experience. Retrospective A/B test and try and identify if there is a statistical significance between designs.

The brief was to design a simple and easy-to-understand UI, where users can easily share stuff that they don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore. The app must stand out from other competitors and create value for the user by being easy-to-use, yet engaging. Ideation Developing a native app was a first for Metaps and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any firsthand user data to work from. We held several meetings, with a projector to discuss planning and strategy. Once we started to define a direction another round of meetings and checkpoints were setup. I used personas to help understand demographics, behaviors, needs and motivations of the user. Iteration Researching the competition helped benchmark industry standards and identify opportunities to innovate upon. I used Balsamiq to quickly create designs for soliciting feedback with the team. I made paper prototypes to quickly test out user flows and then iterate improvements. The biggest challenge was information architecture and simplifying the UI just enough to provide clarity and direction. I decided to utilize icons for globally recognized signifiers such as Comment, Like, and Menu. For less afforded global signifiers (Sale, Trade, Rent, Giveaway) use simple text and colour to distinguish functionality. Group similar functions together and hierarchically order elements according to use-value importance. Implementation Design assets were exported and handed off to the engineer until both iOS and Android apps were ready for review. We used an agile scrum process to cycle through each stage of development. Retrospective Swipe and fade in/out interactions were deployed throughout the app, however, animating the individual elements (Like, Comment and Menu) would delight and provide a more intuitive UX.

Ideation Robot monetization was an off-tangent business for Metaps, and blue-sky thinking was required to move the project forward. A Stakeholder map and some basic storyboarding were used to identify use-case scenarios and how the page could relate to different user groups. Iteration The stakeholder map revealed a connection between Metaps and the developer in much the same way the app monetization business model works. Using the storyboard, I sketched out ideas which incorporated the same narrative and then iterated on these designs to solicit feedback. Luckily we had a cool robot in the office which became a pivotal character for telling this story. Implementation The site was developed with Foundation and to enrich the user experience, the hero image scaled on page scroll with a slight parallax effect on the intro block.

This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts Design and implement modular components for the preexisting dashboard Redesign the landing page In this case study I will only discuss the dashboard funnel and segment analytics tools. Ideation Kickoff meetings were held with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project. These meetings were conducted around a whiteboard, followed up with a round of discussion and, more importantly, a comprehension check of each other&amp;rsquo;s ideas. After that, I used mind mapping to uncover and explore possible solutions. For research, benchmarking the competition and testing out current solutions in the market helped solve some key decisions regarding the user journey. In the example, I created user flows for a funnel to track dropoff and conversion rates. Iteration To achieve quick results, I used Keynote and then, later on, InVision to prototype wireframes into a clickable user experience. Allowing the team to play through the experience and leave comments was invaluable to quickly iterating the design towards a final viable solution. In the example, I use rapid wireframing to test a user flow for saving out a segment. Once the user flows and UI had been signed off, I used Sketch to create high fidelity mocks and iron out any concerns about integration with the existing UI style guide. This process was repeated for other modular dashboard components. Implementation The first stage was to leverage the Foundation framework and Rails asset pipeline to build out static views. Once the layout and sizing were pixel perfect, the focus turned to integrating the motion and how each action would link to the next task. Although the user flow was tested in the out prototype, implementing animations and responders in the UI with jQuery were important for project success. Retrospective Although this product was in its initial stages of development, having more user data prior to the ideation phase would have solved some early decision making.

    "content": "[Overview A careers site for Metaps to continue its growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals. The new page had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials. Ideation Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussing the CEO&amp;rsquo;s vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and worked out a stakeholders map of touchpoints of how each user group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the site should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development. Iteration After benchmarking some other career sites, variations on the blueprint were sketched out and formulated from the ideation phase. Our conversion goal was to get the user to apply for open positions, so we decided on a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research from 37signals also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%. Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic prototypes were test driven. Designs were iterated on and solicited for feedback from the team, CEO, and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item. Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions on what the hero image should be. Implementation This single page site would harbour most of its data in job specification partials, so I turned to AngularJS to leverage and automate the application process and created a slider for the employee interviews. I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build. Retrospective Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity. The top hero image veered on a minimal &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;, and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in job descriptions was extremely convenient. Visit The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.]"

We sat down and discussed the site&amp;rsquo;s value proposition and map out key aspects: what the site is who is the user how will the site be used We narrowed down our blueprint and created a consensus — the visual impact and creativity of the site would be pivotal in engaging with our main user group: game developers. Our primary KPI was to drive inquiries and business leads. Iteration Most of the site assets were already in our possession, so I decided to quickly mark up some mood boards and get an overall sense and direction. The project leader has some ideas and we bounced these around and came up with two distinct designs. We tested our wireframe prototypes and moved forward with two viable designs for a high fidelity mock. Implementation I leveraged Gulp with the Foundation framework and implemented the sticky nav component to achieve maximum exposure for the header on first view. I exported custom icons from Sketch and used Icomoon to read these in with CSS. Retrospective Move out of your comfort zone and experiment. On this occasion, my initial design was very clean and not what the project lead and our target user could relate to. Visit The site is no longer hosted.]"
