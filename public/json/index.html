    "content": "[Overview AI technologies are still in its infancy, but with advancements in the coming years, we could start to imagine a more tailored &amp;lsquo;service&amp;rsquo; around how we do things. I decided it would be interesting to put that theory to the test through a quick design challenge around booking premium class flight tickets. Identifying the target user Airlines managed to grow premium revenue as a share of total sales on key routes such as the transatlantic, which continues to be the biggest premium air market in the world, and also on flights between Europe and Asia. Recent trends with premium class travel Carriers want people to pay for premium-class seats. Airlines have made it harder to earn miles. Some carriers are eschewing first class altogether. More international flights (20% 2016) are premium (US*) User motivation and sentiment Price isn’t a leading user need. Companies usually pay business class for employees, and PAs often purchase for top-level directors and VPs. Experience (before/during/after) includes: Check-in, Airport lounges, Cabin features, Work-related task management, Dinner menu, Service and amenities Time Price Direct vs. 3rd party The experience that accompanies premium travel is the most important user-centric need. Less emphasis is around finding the cheapest ticket, with more emphasis on service, support and status. Some users have negative experiences with 3rd party apps. User needs statement John is a frequent business-class traveller from London to North America and S.E Asia. He expenses travel through his company and uses his flyer miles to upgrade to first class when taking a holiday. John expects the best in-class service, and needs a way to book flights through his preferred airlines, understand what his status entitles him to, and see his accumulated miles with various programs. John is relatively tech-savvy and owns both the latest iPhone and Android mobiles. He reads up on fintech news through TechCrunch and downloads new apps regularly. High-level mapping I decided to focus on going app-direct with destination and dates as the primary user inputs. Ticket class and passenger details would be solved through onboarding and personalisation. The in-flight experience visual communication should be immersive and not require direct inputs from the user. Secondary are nice-to-haves, but out of this project scope. User journey John gets an email from his boss to travel to Singapore for a meeting on Wednesday, Feb. 14th. He must return to London by Friday for another meeting in the afternoon. Receives an email about a meeting Opens booking app Departure from: London (LHR) Destination to: Singapore (SIN) Departure arrive by: Feb. 14 Return arrive by Feb. 16 Ticket class type: Business Airline: Singapore Confirms details Makes payment Gets confirmation email Calendar updates Wireframes I used crazy 8s to diverge my ideas and looked at different paradigms for selecting and booking flights. For example, input boxes, maps, menus and different interactive forms. For me, the chat paradigm offers an exclusive and tailor-made approach to cater for John’s needs. Visual concept I used a moodboard to understand the high-level visual concept. The RAF where influential in choosing the main colour. Mocks Entry point 1. Enter directly through the app. Other in-points could be an email or notification. 2. A warm welcome focused on your mileage and status. The card recedes to the bottom of the screen if not tapped. 3. Your AI-driven PA picks it up from here, with the last question always fading up but still present if you’d like to go back. Selection 1. The AI offers a presonalised experience. ‘Chips’ populate the bottom and act as your response to the AI. 2. The Chips are versatile and include voice and context-relative icons to activate more complex UI like a date picker. 3. All selected chips remain present at the top right. To go back, tap any chip to jump to that point. Check out 1. Flights are presented in horizontal list form. Icons provide quick context to the experience onboard. 2. Cards expand to full-screen immersive experiences. John can watch videos to see what’s onboard before making a decision. 3. Information is simplified and displayed for confirmation. Prototype The flow includes: 1. Flight destination and time selection 2. Understanding what’s onboard 3. Confirmation and check-out I used Framer to put this together because I wanted to understand the functionality and granular motion between interactions. Apart from prototyping this experience, during the design stage I tested flows on my mobile as simple click-throughs - which was very useful for understanding the flow! Project post-mortem Didn’t work My solution worked for a couple of choices, however, this isn’t built to scale. The value I placed on offering John an executive experience outweighed the overall usefulness of the UI. In the real-world, an AI that doesn’t nail your expectations will lead to poor UX. Did work Breaking the mould with the traditional flight booking interface. From a high-level, the way you respond to questions creates a narrative which maps to a vertical timeline of your activity. Do differently User testing in the initial stages around basic concepts. The chat paradigm is pretty verbose, and my assumption is that users might just want to jump right into a list view with filters.

    "content": "[Overview The connected home is becoming a reality for more and more people. This project explored a smart oven concept and some of the design implications of such an app. Identifying the target user Since this was a quick personal project, I harvested secondary research to understand who might benefit most from using a smart oven. Here&amp;rsquo;s a TL;DR of the salient points: British women with children feel the most pressure to start chores, including cooking, after returning home from work Working British parents between the ages of 16-25 experience the most burnout after work The average Brit spends below 5.9 hours a week in the kitchen 26% of Brits are passionate about cooking 22% of Brits would say they are knowledgeable UK Women spend more time cooking than men Older age groups with more income tend to spend more on groceries per week Saving money is the main reason to cook at home (US) 58% of full-time workers cook at home 3-6 times a week (US) User stories There was an overwhelming amount of secondary research on working mums struggling to cope with work and family life. I have such a hard time trying to scheduling in cooking&amp;hellip; was a common quote from the working mums forum Source Insights and assumptions To focus the design, I narrowed down on who might benefit most from a smart oven. Working mums have underserved needs to provide meals after commuting home Saving money and eating a healthier diet are the top reasons to cook at home Smart home penetration is forecast for 24% in 2018 with adults aged 35-44 making the most frequent online purchases Parents with children would eat the same meals together, as opposed to babies under 12 months Smart home adoption drops off for people aged 45 and over Food preparation is required but can be a user pain-point of knowing how to create variance, and plan accordingly. User needs statement Sonia is a full-time office worker who recently returned to work after her second child. She needs a way to cook meals when she&amp;rsquo;s not able to be in the kitchen. She has a hard time scheduling time to cook and wants to spend more time with her family. Her goal is to provide healthy, home-cooked meals throughout the week. Hypothesis From my research, I’ve listed 3 main product design goals. The main use case is to start and finish the cooking process when no-one is present. On time It’s crucial that dinner is cooked and ready for a specific time; children (and some adults) can become irritated when hungry. The design needs to prioritise a user&amp;rsquo;s time when interacting with the product. Design affordances need to be clear when communicating important details. Reporting Mums on the go don’t necessarily have time to check an app - especially ones who drive. The product must help decide when food is ready and provide a preventative way to stop over/under cooking. The design must reflect state changes; not cooking, programmed to cook, cooking in progress, and cooking finished. Suggestions and tracking Through planning and creating variance, the product must be universally understandable, to the point that mums can make good decisions around food preparation. The design must offer intuitive guidance on where information lives and clarity around suggestions based on user behaviour. User journey mapping Splitting out Sonia&amp;rsquo;s journey with the product experience helped prioritize and focus the design. Post-it notes are a designer&amp;rsquo;s best friend! Actions Motivations Moments of truth (emotions) Interactions, touch-points Obstacles, pain-points Value Proposition To save time. Cook scheduled meals away from home; always ready on time, and cooked to perfection. User flow Cook dinner for tonight This scenario describes the process of putting your meal in the oven, then setting a time to eat and what you&amp;rsquo;ve prepared. The other use case when there&amp;rsquo;s no oven interaction but you still want to preheat the oven is out of this project scope. Oven cleanliness reports and settings are a secondary use case that will also live outside the scope of this project. Design principles Based on Sonia’s needs, it was important to outline 3 design principles. Direct, task focused The design should move out the way and hand-hold through to successful task completion. Technical jargon around numerical values should be kept to a minimum. Busy mums don&amp;rsquo;t want to do calculations, they’d rather get the job done, and might not have time to explore product features. Bold and universal Safety is a top concern. Sonia should feel in control and kept in the know about the status of her oven. Clarity around the design is key to quickly understanding oven parameters. Useful The product should be more utility than content, meant for repeated daily use and provide value efficiently. The core interactions, the ones around oven and hob control, are streamlined, purged of unnecessary questions. Ideation Creating a matrix with feature states and use cases, I was able to focus in on the main problems to solve for. Wireframes I iterated on wireframes (v1 to v2) to get task flow feeling natural and intuitive. Adding selected parameters to the flow and keeping things uncluttered were the hardest part of the design process. Mocks First round of design explorations with 2 different colour swatches. Some of the main challenges so far: How not to display the same information twice (time, dish) How to balance alignment left and UI element that didn’t fall under full-width patterns How to keep a consistent colour strategy relevant to the oven states Hierarchy of text, scale and line heights. Some initial tests with the first prototype, and further discussion with another designer led to the following discoveries: The call-to-action affordances aren&amp;rsquo;t clear enough, make it more universal The visual design is bland and without character If you make a mistake, how do you go back the relationship between the oven and what you&amp;rsquo;re doing isn&amp;rsquo;t clear I built this prototype to understand what was working, and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Mocks R2 From the first design, I tried to address all four issues: Make CTAs visually more intuitive Balance colours with layout, leverage icons Implement a stepper to provide clarity and revisions the relationship between the oven and what you&amp;rsquo;re doing isn&amp;rsquo;t clear Using Framer, I quickly put this protoype together. Project post mortem Didn&amp;rsquo;t work Time management was over the allocated 4-6 hours. Since this was a hypothetical project, less time on research and more time on the design seemed a reasonable trade-off. Did work Product-market fit and target user needs seemed to hit the right notes for me. By understanding the problem, I was able to focus my design on what the user needed, rather than polluting my scope with other features. Do differently User testing and prototyping early-on. Given the project constraints, I jumped a few bases to get to a finished state. Handing this to a working mum would have been the cherry on the top!

    "title": "Food delivery",
    "tags": [],
    "categories": [],
    "content": "[Overview Food delivery is heating up, globally. Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Swiggy, Amazon, and a whole lot more are fighting it out for customer loyalty. I decided to take a stab at trying to understand rewarding loyalty in this space through a design challenge. Framing the problem For this hypothetical design challenge, I&amp;rsquo;ve conjured up a UK-based food delivery company, Chive. At some point in the future, Chive wants to treat the loyalty of their growing user base. The key stakeholders are looking for an incentive that could interest customers to make a repeat purchase, and amplify their brand awareness and perception. Chive is built on the new-delivery model; controlling the end-to-end experience from order through to delivery. Loyalty is high for the new-delivery model (see right), however, competition from Deliveroo and Uber Eats is fierce. How can Chive offer users something that the competition doesn’t have and grab a share of the market? Project scope Before the project ballons, I needed to work out the project scope. In scope - A high-level take an incentive plan - Communicating the incentive - Placement and timing of incentive - First-level branding and implementation of the incentive Out of scope - Hi-fi mocks for all parts of the ordering experience, including settings, profile and other auxiliary functions - User testing plan, results and analysis My high-level take on how I&amp;rsquo;ll approach this challenge. Reasons to order Promotional deals or loyalty schemes ranked low, between 4-10%, on reasons to choose a particular food delivery company. Food delivery apps are a very focused utility, i.e, you’re only going to open the app when you want to, or plan to eat. It’s my hypothesis that food quality and value drive user satisfaction and the app experience is indirectly affected by a meal that doesn’t satisfy users’ expectations. Chive will want to make a connection with the user to drive re-engagement for repeat use. Target user 18-34 represent the highest frequency user group. Digging into this, 25% order at least once a week and over 50% every month. Some other sources point to students, and their inability or lack of motivation to cook. Working professionals are the other target group, however, some sources point to a trend in ordering in meals to cook, as opposed to the standard delivery meal. Loyalty programs Subscriptions services for food delivery are on the rise. Subscriptions are a great way to build habit-forming behaviour, if made affordable enough for the the target user. Deliveroo Deliveroo Plus offer an annual subscription for £95.88 Amazon Amazon Prime is also £95.88 for the year, but the delivery will still cost £1.99 Various Pre-made cook boxes are a new trend in food delivery. These are meals you do need to cook yourself so don&amp;rsquo;t quite fall into the same field. Defining the target group UK students spend most of their budget on food delivery or takeaway because of convenience, and/or don’t know how to cook from scratch. It’s my assumption that students would not pay the up-front costs to subscribe to a service like Deliveroo or join Amazon Prime. The margins are small, but Chive has the opportunity to gain traction with the student market, and since students have been trend-setters in tech markets, Chive could increase brand perception with similar age groups. Student retention ideas 1. Social buying Students can club together and drive down the price of a delivery through economies of scale, i.e bulk buying. Groups can customise their group for repeat purchases, split payments and avail cashbacks. 2. Off-peak discounts Provide a time window during off-peak hours when restaurants aren’t busy and want to make sales. Students who’ve used the service before get notifications when there’s a lull in a sales and can get discounts in return. 3. Excess waste Restaurants with soon-expiring food can create rush deals for students before the close of business. Choice would be limited, but the food should still match food hygiene standards. Students can opt-in for last-minute notifications. Persona User needs statement Ruth is in her first year at university studying psychology in South London. This is her first time living away from home. She orders food delivery with her 5 flatmates at least three times a week. Ruth values social time with her friends over time spent in the kitchen. She feels the standard delivery fee is too expensive and cannot justify paying for a subscription service with Amazon or Deliveroo Plus. She needs a way to order food for everyone, but avoid paying an expensive £4 delivery fee or an up-front subscription. Problem &amp;amp; incentive scheme overview What is the business objective? Increase user loyalty – get users invested in the product to use it again What is the context of product use? Food delivery to students, regular use 3 times p/week What are the user goals? - Make savings - Social bonding/eating - Ease of ordering groups, splitting bills (or not being left out of pocket) Proposal Social reward system for students. 1) Group discount 2) Loyalty reward each time they use the app How it works Students group their orders together into one transaction. Food discounts increase proportionally to the order size. Food delivery fees are reduced per delivery, creating a reason to use Chive again. Delivery discounts only apply to the same address. Example of some potential scaling: High level flow Understanding the end-to-end user journey is important to know when/where to make the incentive known to Ruth and even the students in the group. This is not the first order by Ruth, so user onboarding will not be covered. Ruth decides to order pizza with 4 other flatmates Ruth selects her address and a list of possible restaurants are shown. Ruth understands the incentives earned so far and what she will earn on the next order She selects the restaurant, “Wildwood Pizza” Ruth sets up the group and initiates bluetooth invites. The invite includes an incentive to join the order and get a bigger discount for everyone Each student joins the group and selects from the menu. Since Joe and Lisa from next door are in Ruth’s contacts, they also get bluetooth invites and join the order Ruth authorises Joe and Lisa’s request to join After food selection, each student has a time window to make payment to a virtual wallet which holds the money. Once all the students have ordered and paid, Ruth gets a confirmation screen. If any of the students fail to pay, or doesn’t order in time, Ruth can decide to change or cancel the order. Upon task completion, Ruth gets a summary of incentives earned, and this primes Ruth for the next time she wants food delivery. Ideation and iteration Visual concept Hats off to some inspiration from some world-class designers on Dribbble! I Liked all your work shown :) Chive is aiming for a Personality that&amp;rsquo;s social, vibrant, fresh, organic, transparent and foodie! Mocks These mocks focus on the user journey, I want to order pizza with my friends Entry point 1. Background processes run and incentive value prop #1 is shown 2. Location is pinpointed and incentive value prop #2 is shown 3. The first screen provides a summary of stats around Ruth’s usage. Saving money is a big incentive to use Chive. But this doesn’t ‘block’ the primary action to order food. Ordering 1. Adding friends is the primary CTA. To collapse, Ruth could scroll the food item list. 2. Ruth’s nearby contacts receive an invite. The circles animate to convey bluetooth sending a signal. Contacts can also be blacklisted in settings. 3. A scrollable list of contacts display. On-scroll would collapse the green signal animation. Order success 1. Ruth’s friends receive a notification to join. Customisation and scheduling can also be achieved. 2. Once accepted, an avatar gets the 100% opacity green UI. Ruth can still order, nothing blocks her.. 3. Animated confetti communicates task success. Brands can add their own ‘yay’ moment. Project post-mortem Did work Overall, I was pleased with the complexity and challenge this project presented. The problem space was quite vast, and I think I narrowed down a good solution for the target user, Ruth. Didn&amp;rsquo;t work Scoping the project and time management were difficult to keep a hand on. There were large parts of the experience that I would have liked more time to work on, but given this was a hypothetical company, the prioritising would have been difficult. Do differently Simplifying everything right down from the start. My idea to capture two incentives may have watered down my final execution. Social was fun to work on, but the flat rate delivery fee discount was lacking some user delight.

The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and delivered one integrated brand experience. Ideation Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site. We also carried out a heuristic analysis of the current site to identify what needed to change and why. Our KPI was to springboard a new marketing campaign before the IPO and drive business leads through a contact page. Iteration Doing a content audit we came up with a site map and good starting point for sketching. There would be five pages: home, analytics, promotion, engagement, and revenue. I took a mobile-first approach to focus on content structure over element positioning. Wireframes were developed into clickable prototypes. I kept the visuals light and unobtrusive to match the dashboard&amp;rsquo;s style guide and other products which I&amp;rsquo;d previously designed. To bring a unique level of branding to the project I did a photo shoot focusing on displaying the product on laptops and mobile. High-level mocks were test driven with InVision and solicited for group feedback. Implementation To scale and rapidly code the site, PHP partials were used for repeatable header, footer, and nav elements, then implement Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation to do the heavy lifting. A sub nav was implemented that became fixed on scrolling to highlight your current position and provide a more intuitive user experience. Retrospective A/B test and try and identify if there&amp;rsquo;s a statistical significance between designs. A design sprint involving all the stakeholders may have created a more diverse and interesting outcome. Visit www.metaps.com Designs are subject to change since leaving Metaps. The final UI design:]"

    "content": "[Overview Spike Box is a social networking app and similar in concept to Craigslist but with followers. The brief was to design a simple and easy-to-understand UI, where users can easily share stuff that they don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore. The app must stand out from other competitors and create value for the user by being easy-to-use, yet engaging. Ideation Developing a native app was a first for Metaps and we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any firsthand user data to work from. We held several meetings, with a projector to discuss planning and strategy. Once we started to define a direction another round of meetings and checkpoints were setup. I used personas to help understand demographics, behaviors, needs and motivations of the user. Iteration Researching the competition helped benchmark industry standards and identify opportunities to innovate upon. I used Balsamiq to quickly create designs for soliciting feedback with the team. I made paper prototypes to quickly test out user flows and then iterate improvements. The biggest challenge was information architecture and simplifying the UI just enough to provide clarity and direction. I decided to utilize icons for globally recognized signifiers such as Comment, Like, and Menu. For less afforded global signifiers (Sale, Trade, Rent, Giveaway) use simple text and colour to distinguish functionality. Group similar functions together and hierarchically order elements according to use-value importance. Implementation Design assets were exported and handed off to the engineer until both iOS and Android apps were ready for review. We used an agile scrum process to cycle through each stage of development. Retrospective Swipe and fade in/out interactions were deployed throughout the app, however, animating the individual elements (Like, Comment and Menu) would delight and provide a more intuitive UX.

    "content": "[Overview Metaps is an app monetization platform focused on how to maximize revenue and optimize campaign performance. This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts: Design and implement modular components for the preexisting dashboard Redesign the landing page In this case study, I will only discuss the dashboard funnel and segment analytics tools. Ideation Kickoff meetings were held with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project. These meetings were conducted around a whiteboard, followed up with a round of discussion and, more importantly, a comprehension check of each other&amp;rsquo;s ideas. After that, I used mind mapping to uncover and explore possible solutions. For research, benchmarking the competition and testing out current solutions in the market helped solve some key decisions regarding the user journey. In the example, I created user flows for a funnel to track dropoff and conversion rates. Iteration To achieve quick results, I used Keynote and then, later on, InVision to prototype wireframes into a clickable user experience. Allowing the team to play through the experience and leave comments proved invaluable to quickly iterate on designs. In the example, I use rapid wireframing to test a user flow for saving out a segment. Once the user flows and UI had been signed off, I used Sketch to create high fidelity mocks and surface any concerns about integration with the existing UI style guide. This process was repeated for other modular dashboard components. Implementation The initial stage leveraged the Foundation framework and Rails asset pipeline to build out static views. Once the layout and sizing were pixel perfect, the focus turned to integrating the motion and how each action would link to the next task. Although the user flows were tested in the prototype, implementing animations and responders in the UI with jQuery were important for user experience. Retrospective Although this product was in its initial stages of development, having more user data prior to the ideation phase would have solved some early decision making.

The site must be able to communicate the company&amp;rsquo;s vision through an easy-to-understand narrative. Ideation Robot monetization was an off-tangent business for Metaps, and blue-sky thinking was required to move the project forward. A Stakeholder map and some basic storyboarding identified use-case scenarios and how the product could relate to different user groups. Iteration The stakeholder map revealed a connection between Metaps and the developer in much the same way the app monetization business model works. Using the storyboard, I sketched out ideas which incorporated the same narrative and then iterated on these designs to solicit feedback. Luckily we had a cool robot in the office which became a pivotal character for telling our story. Implementation The site utilized Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation and to enrich the UX the hero image scaled on page scroll with a slight parallax effect. See the demo below.

    "content": "[Overview A careers landing page to spearhead Metap&amp;rsquo;s continued growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals. The experience had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials. Ideation Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussed the CEO&amp;rsquo;s vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and identified stakeholders with touchpoints of how each user group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the experience should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development. Iteration We benchmarked other career sites, looking at what worked well and things to avoid. This process helped formulate our design strategy blueprint. We set our KPI to increase online application conversions by 50%, which lead to a decision to build a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research from 37signals also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%. Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic prototypes were test driven. These leading designs were iterated and solicited for feedback from the team, CEO, and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item. Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions on what the hero image should represent. Implementation This single page site would harbour most of its data in hidden job specification partials, so I implemented AngularJS to leverage and modularize the applications and employee carousel. I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build. Retrospective Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity. The top hero image veered on a minimal &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;, and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in JSON proved extremely important for future projects. Visit The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.]"

The site must showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow. Ideation For this project, I started working with a new project leader (a crazy but very nice guy). We sat down and discussed the site&amp;rsquo;s value proposition and map out key aspects: what the site is who is the user how will the site be used We narrowed down our blueprint and created a consensus — the visual impact and creativity of the site would be pivotal in engaging with our main user group – the game developer. Our primary KPI was to drive inquiries and business leads. Iteration Most of the site assets were already in our possession, so I decided to quickly mark up some mood boards and get an overall sense of direction. The project leader has some ideas and we bounced these around and came up with two distinct designs. We tested our wireframe prototypes and moved forward with two viable designs for a high fidelity mock. Implementation I leveraged Gulp with Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation framework and implemented the sticky nav component to achieve maximum exposure for the header on first view. I exported custom icons from Sketch and used Icomoon to read these in with CSS. Retrospective Move out of your comfort zone and experiment. On this occasion, my initial minimal, clean design was not what the project lead and our target user could relate to. Visit The site is no longer hosted.]"
