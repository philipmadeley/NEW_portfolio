The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and deliver one integrated brand experience. Ideation Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site. We also carried out a heuristic analysis of the current site to identify what needed to change and why. Our KPI was to use the site to springboard marketing campaigns before the IPO and drive business leads through a contact page. Iteration Using a content audit and site map, I started to sketch out the five main pages: home, analytics, promotion, engagement and revenue. I took a mobile-first approach to put focus on content structure over element positioning. Wireframes were developed into simple clickable prototypes. I kept the visuals light and unobtrusive to match the dashboard&amp;rsquo;s style guide and other sites which I&amp;rsquo;d made previously. To bring a unique level of branding to the project I did a photoshoot which the dashboard on mobile devices and laptops. High level mocks were test driven with InVision and solicited for feedback. Implementation To scale and rapidly produce the site, php partials were used for repeatable elements and Zurb&amp;rsquo;s Foundation to do the heavy lifting. A sub nav was implemented that became fixed on scrolling to highlight your current position and provide a more intuitive user experience.

The new page had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials. Ideation Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussing the CEO&amp;rsquo;s vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and worked out a stakeholders map of touchpoints of how each group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the site should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development. Iteration After benchmarking some other career sites, I sketched out variations on the blueprint we formulated in the ideation phase. Our conversion goal was to get the user to apply for open positions, so we decided on a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research (from 37signals) also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%. Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic user flow prototypes were test driven. Iterating on the various designs, I solicited feedback from the team, CEO and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item. Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions. Say no more. Implementation Deceiving in nature, this single page site would actually harbour most of its data in job specification partials. I turned to AngularJS to leverage and automate the application process and created a slider for the employee interviews. I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build. Retropsective Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity. The top hero image veered on a minimal &amp;lsquo;cool&amp;rsquo;, and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in job descriptions was extremely convenient. Visit The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
