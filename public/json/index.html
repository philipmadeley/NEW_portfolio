Retrospective Make consistent user research a part of your process. There is only so much time in the day, but I always wish there was more time for customer feedback and user research. We have performed lightweight, guerrilla research at Starbucks coffee shops, remote usability sessions, and even in-person workshops with some of our current customers, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t consistent.
