<!-- The 'singletons' folder is created for one-off pages that otherwise don't fit into the rest of your site structure/templates (eg, promotional pages that would require a short ULR). The permalink for singleton pages is set /:title/ (see config.toml) rather than using the filename for the slug. With the default settings, you don't need to create a list page for singleton pages since the idea is that these one-off pages are not logically related.

The partials below assumes singletons will include the same chrome (ie, site head, site header, and site footer) as the rest of the site. 

NOTE: Singleton permalinks are set to the title of the markdown in config.toml. The rest of Hugo starter uses slug/filename for permalinks. You can change this setting in config.toml via, eg, "/:title/" to temp = "/:filename/"-->

{{ partial "site_header.html" . }}
<main class="main">
	{{.Content}}
</main>
{{ partial "site_footer.html" . }}


<!-- If you want your singleton pages to be standalone HTML (ie, without site chrome), delete {{ partial "site_header.html" . }} and  {{ partial "site_footer.html" . }} and leave only {{.Content}}" in the template.-->
