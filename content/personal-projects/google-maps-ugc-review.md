## Design Challenge
UGC (user-generated content) is enriching Google Maps from just a route planner before, now the app can be your guide to doing things. On the surface, looking at the rating and reading reviews can often be enough to make a yes-no decision about eating in a restaurant, drinking in a bar or entering a venue. I decided to focus on restaurants for this challenge and make the UGC more granular by quickly showing a succession of rating categories for food, service and value in addition to the overall rating. This would bring a few immediate benefits:

1. allows busy people who don't have the time to write a review for quick input
2. helps structure a review if they decide to write one (food, service, value)
3. helps other users understand a more in-depth rating per venue

If you have any feedback or ways to improve this prototype, I'd be happy to chat through any of the social channels below.
