## Overview
Metaps is an app monetization platform focused on how to maximize revenue and optimize campaign performance.
This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts: the first was to redesign the landing page, the second was to integrate new features into the preexisting dashboard.

## Ideation
I worked with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project before conducting user research and benchmarking the competition.
After that, I started with a phase of ideation, which included mindmaps, brainstorming and quick paper sketching. 
Finally, I started to develop the more viable solutions into wireframes, which would and take us to another round of discussion.

## Implementation
User research and benchmarking the competition was vital to creating a solid product which would drive growth and ultimately the success of the platform.

## Process & Involvement
* Wireframe + prototype
* Art direction + branding
* UI design + frontend

## Focus Point
Allow the user to quickly view and understand key features of the dashboard within a constrained amount of screen space.

## Focus Solution
Integrate a center-aligned carousel, which is both responsive and slide-enabled for mobile viewing.

## Visit
The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.
