## Overview
Kirin, a major drink manufacturer, wanted to increase awareness of a new product (Off White) through a custom landing page experience.

## Goals
Since the product was new to the market, Kirin wanted to focus on two goals:
1. Educate the customer about the product
2. Motivate the customer to buy the product

## Concept
We had great support from Kirin's marketing team and leveraged their user research to create an immersive page around activities associated with relaxing at home after work with a beer. A big part of the experience was around connecting homely activities with different products available on Amazon. Those categories included: reading, tableware, DIY, cooking, and movies.

Below is an overview of iterative design with wireframes.

We provided Kirin with important insights into their users through targeted metrics throughout the page.

## Final Campaign
The user journey starts with an overview of the product, followed by a breakdown of what Off White is. The carousel slider provides an opportunity for the user to connect with various lifestyle activities associated with being at home. Although the page seems content heavy, this <i>busy</i> style is often favoured in Japan and China. Kirin also provided a downloadable song that enriched the experience.
