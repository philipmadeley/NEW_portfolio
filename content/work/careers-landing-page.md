## Overview
A careers landing page to spearhead Metap's continued growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals. The experience had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials.

## Ideation
Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussed the CEO's vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and identified stakeholders with touchpoints of how each user group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the experience should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development.

## Iteration
We benchmarked other career sites, looking at what worked well and things to avoid. This process helped formulate our design strategy blueprint. We set our KPI to increase online application conversions by 50%, which lead to a decision to build a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research from [37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highrise-marketing-site-ab-testing-part-1 "User testing from 37signals") also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%.

Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic prototypes were test driven. These leading designs were iterated and solicited for feedback from the team, CEO, and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item.   Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions on what the hero image should represent.

## Implementation
This single page site would harbour most of its data in hidden job specification partials, so I implemented AngularJS to leverage and modularize the applications and employee carousel.  I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build.

## Retrospective
Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity.  The top hero image veered on a minimal 'cool', and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in JSON proved extremely important for future projects.

## Visit
The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
