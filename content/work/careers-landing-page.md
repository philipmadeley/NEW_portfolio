## Overview
A careers site for Metaps to continue its growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals.
The new page had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials.

## Ideation
Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussing the CEO's vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and worked out a stakeholders map of touchpoints of how each group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the site should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development.

## Iteration
After benchmarking some other career sites, I sketched out variations on the blueprint we formulated in the ideation phase. Our conversion goal was to get the user to apply for open positions, so we decided on a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research (from [37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highrise-marketing-site-ab-testing-part-1
 "User testing from 37signals")) also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%.

Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic user flow prototypes were test driven. Iterating on the various designs, I solicited feedback from the team, CEO and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item.  Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions. Say no more.

## Implementation
Deceiving in nature, this single page site would actually harbour most of its data in job specification partials. I turned to AngularJS to leverage and automate the application process and created a slider for the employee interviews.  I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build. 

## Retropsective
Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity.  The top hero image veered on a minimal 'cool', and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in job descriptions was extremely convenient.

## Visit
The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.
