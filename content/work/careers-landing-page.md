## Overview
Metaps is an app monetization platform focused on how to maximize revenue and optimize campaign performance.
This was an on-going project over about 16 months which was split into two parts: the first part was to redesign the landing page â€“ which was not I'm not going to cover in this case study.  What will be discussed in more detail, are the UI features for the dashboard.

## Ideation
I worked with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project.
These kickoff meetings were focused on whiteboard sketches, followed up with a round of discussion and more importantly comprehension of each others' ideas.
After that, I would brainstorm and use other ideation techniques to evolve a series of possible solutions.
Benchmarking the competition and testing out current solutions in the market helped solve some key decisions regarding the user journey.

## Iteration
Finally, I started to develop the more viable solutions into wireframe journey maps, which would and take us to another round of discussion.
To achieve quick results, I used Invision to prototype the wireframes into a clickable user experience.
Allowing several employees to click through the experience and leave comments was invaluable to quickly iterating the design towards a final viable solution.
Once the user flow and UI had been fine tuned, I moved to Sketch to create high fidelity mocks and iron out any concerns about integration with the existing UI (built by my team mate).

## Implementation
The first stage was to leverage the Foundation framework and Rails asset pipeline to build out a static views. Once the layout and sizing were pixel perfect, the focus turned to the user journey and how each action would link to the next task.
Luckily we had already tested this with our prototype.

## Retropsective
Although this product was in its initial stages of development, having more user data at hand could of helped with some of the decision making.

## Visit
The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.
