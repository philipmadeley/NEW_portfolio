## Overview
A careers site for Metaps to continue its growth and recruitment of tech industry professionals. The new page had to attract potential talent, focus on Metaps roadmap for success and highlight its industry credentials.

## Ideation
Our kickoff meeting started with whiteboard sketches and discussing the CEO's vision and strategy for setting the right message. We brainstormed various ideas and worked out a stakeholders map of touchpoints of how each user group could engage with Metaps on a deeper level. We identified the site should mix personal attachment and present clear opportunities for career development.

## Iteration
After benchmarking some other career sites, variations on the blueprint were sketched out and formulated from the ideation phase. Our conversion goal was to get the user to apply for open positions, so we decided on a single page, which could immerse the user in a linear start-to-finish experience. Referencing user research from [37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2977-behind-the-scenes-highrise-marketing-site-ab-testing-part-1 "User testing from 37signals") also told us that single-page sites have a conversion increase of 37.5%.

Viable sketches were turned into wireframes and some basic prototypes were test driven. Designs were iterated on and solicited for feedback from the team, CEO, and other stakeholders. To personalize the experience, we interviewed employees and did a mini photoshoot, with each employee bringing in a characterising item.  Final design selection was tough going with conflicting opinions on what the hero image should be.

## Implementation
This single page site would harbour most of its data in job specification partials, so I turned to AngularJS to leverage and automate the application process and created a slider for the employee interviews.  I used Gulp to enhance the workflow and generate the production build.

## Retrospective
Decisions made outside my jurisdiction evolved the site away from the initial goal to mix personal attachment with career opportunity.  The top hero image veered on a minimal 'cool', and IMHO should have been more inviting. On the execution site, I wrote the site in AngularJS, which was overkill for a simple site. That said, using partials to pull in job descriptions was extremely convenient.

The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
