## Overview
To design and code a new landing page for Metaps which introduces a business model to monetize robot development. The site must be able to communicate the company's vision through an easy-to-understand narrative.

## Design Process 
See the sketch for stakeholders and the design, maybe a simple user journey and some simple user reseach from Google Analytics.

## Process & Involvement
* Wireframe + prototype
* Art direction + photography
* UI design + front-end development

## Sketching
As with all projects, I always start on paper and try to generate as many ideas as possible. Unltimately, the ideation and branching off will lead to a springboard for the wireframe. 

## Wireframe
[include image of responsive wireframe] Talk about information architecture here (one page or lack of it)

## Branding
Include the color pallet. Talk about the photograhpy you took
 
## Interaction
A content-light landing page which required an enriched user experience right from the start of interacting with the page.
Create an on-scroll animation for the top section, which smoothly leads you to the next section of content whilst simultaneously reducing the navigation header in size.

## Retrospective
Make consistent user research a part of your process.
There is only so much time in the day, but I always wish there was more time for customer feedback and user research. We have performed lightweight, guerrilla research at Starbucks coffee shops, remote usability sessions, and even in-person workshops with some of our current customers, but it wasn't consistent. Iâ€™m always in awe at the gold mine of information and clarity these sessions bring.
