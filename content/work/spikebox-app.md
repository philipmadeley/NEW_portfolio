## Overview
Spike Box is a social networking app and similar in concept to Craigslist. 
The brief was to design a simple and easy-to-understand UI, where users can easily share item photos with friends and followers. The app must stand out from other competitors while still creating a simple yet engaging product which aligns to the Spike branding experience.

## Ideation
Developing a native app was a first for Metaps and we didn't have any specific user data to work from. We held several meetings, with a projector to discuss planning and strategy. Once we started to define a direction another round of meetings and checkpoints were setup (it was a lengthy process!).

I worked with a product manager to figure out the goals, scope, and constraints of each project.
These kickoff meetings were focused on whiteboard sketches, followed up with a round of discussion and more importantly comprehension of each others' ideas.
After that, I would brainstorm and use other ideation techniques to evolve a series of possible solutions.
Benchmarking the competition and testing out current solutions in the market helped solve some key decisions regarding the user journey.

## Iteration
Finally, I started to develop the more viable solutions into wireframe journey maps, which would and take us to another round of discussion.
To achieve quick results, I used Invision to prototype the wireframes into a clickable user experience.
Allowing several employees to click through the experience and leave comments was invaluable to quickly iterating the design towards a final viable solution.
Once the user flow and UI had been fine tuned, I moved to Sketch to create high fidelity mocks and iron out any concerns about integration with the existing UI (built by my team mate).

## Implementation
The first stage was to leverage the Foundation framework and Rails asset pipeline to build out a static views. Once the layout and sizing were pixel perfect, the focus turned to the user journey and how each action would link to the next task.
Luckily we had already tested this with our prototype.

## Retropsective
Although this product was in its initial stages of development, having more user data at hand could of helped with some of the decision making.

## Visit
The landing page was rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.
The dashboard can be accessed with a user account only.

Focus Point
Design an integrated experience where users can easily label photos under the categories; Sale, Trade, Rent or Giveaway. The UI must provide well-balanced synergy between other elements and not increase cognitive load to the user.

Focus Solution
Utilize icons for globally recognized signifiers such as Comment, Like and Menu. For less afforded global signifiers (Sale, Trade, Rent, Giveaway) use simple text and colour to distinguish functionality. Group similar functions together and hierarchically order elements according to use-value importance.
