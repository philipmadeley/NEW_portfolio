## Overview
Yo-Kai Watch, the number-one rated cartoon sensation from creators Level-5 and media giant Dentsu, wanted to increase awareness of the upcoming movie through a custom landing page. This was a massive effort spanning numerous teams, a tie-up with Amazon Prime Video and multiple vendors of branded goods.

## Goals

1. Increase awareness of the upcoming movie
2. Promote Amazon Prime Video's tie-up


## Final Campaign
We leveraged the two main characters for the first-view screen and focused a call-to-action button under the movie trailer. After watching the trailer, the CTA took you to a ticketing site. The tie-up with Prime Video become the 2nd primary slot, and each of the main characters become an anchor to guide the user down the product carousels.
