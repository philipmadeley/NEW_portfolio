## Overview
To design and develop a highly visual landing page with unique branding to attract app developers and other potential clients. The site must be able to showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow.

## Process & Involvement
* Ideation + Wireframe
* Art direction + branding
* UI design + Front-end development

## Focus Point
The conventional method of placing the header at the top of the page would interfere with the grace and beauty of the illustrations.

## Focus Solution
Place the header at the base of the slider and allow a scroll event to trigger when this element reaches the top of the page. The bulk of the header is also reduced, providing more space for other content.
