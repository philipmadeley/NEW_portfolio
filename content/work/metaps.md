## Overview
Metaps was preparing for its IPO and required a rebranding overhaul of its flagship site. The brief was to create a multilingual, responsive site which highlighted key product features and delivered one integrated brand experience.

## Ideation
Our kickoff meeting looked at the metrics from the dashboard to surface popular pages and help plan out a site map. Mapping out the site on a whiteboard made it easy to visualize the basic structure and navigation required across the site. We also carried out a heuristic analysis of the current site to identify what needed to change and why. Our KPI was to springboard a new marketing campaign before the IPO and drive business leads through a contact page.

## Iteration
Doing a content audit we came up with a site map and good starting point for sketching.  There would be five pages: home, analytics, promotion, engagement, and revenue. I took a mobile-first approach to focus on content structure over element positioning.

Wireframes were developed into clickable prototypes. I kept the visuals light and unobtrusive to match the dashboard's style guide and other products which I'd previously designed. To bring a unique level of branding to the project I did a photo shoot focusing on displaying the product on laptops and mobile. High-level mocks were test driven with InVision and solicited for group feedback.

## Implementation
To scale and rapidly code the site, PHP partials were used for repeatable header, footer, and nav elements, then implement Zurb's Foundation to do the heavy lifting. A sub nav was implemented that became fixed on scrolling to highlight your current position and provide a more intuitive user experience.

## Retrospective
A/B test and try and identify if there's a statistical significance between designs. A design sprint involving all the stakeholders may have created a more diverse and interesting outcome.
