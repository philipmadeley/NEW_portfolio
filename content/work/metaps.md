## Overview
Design and develop a rebranded flagship website for Metaps Inc. The site must include key product features and deliver one integrated brand experience, which defines the Metaps marketing strategy. The site must be responsive and multilingual in five different languages.

## Process + Involvement
* Wireframe + prototype
* Art direction + photography
* UI design + Front-end development

## Focus Point
Due to an extensive list of product features, the UX had to provide an intuitive way for users to navigate between product features whilst not polluting the main content space.

## Focus Solution
Create a detachable sticky navigation menu that will scroll the page to selected features whilst highlighting the user's current location.
