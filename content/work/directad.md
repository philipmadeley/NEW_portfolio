![Hero for DirectAd project](/images/me_top_sm@2x.jpg)

## Overview
DirectAd was an extension of the Metaps ad platform, offering zero commission CPC. The project brief was to design and develop two separate landing pages which highlights key product features and provides appropriate call-to-action dialogue. The site must incorporate an integrated brand experience for both advertiser and publisher pages.

## Focus Point
Differentiate between the publisher and advertiser pages whilst maintaining a centralised brand experience and layout that is similar in both structure and rhythm.

## Focus Solution
Create two swatch palettes â€” the publisher UI veering towards more monochromatic tones and advertiser incorporating brighter more contrasting colours. Provide cohesion between iconography, typography, background motifs and imagery.

## Visit
Rebranded under www.metaps.com as of June 2015.

## Overview
To design and develop a single page site with unique branding to attract app developers and other potential clients. The site had to be able to showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow.

## Ideation
For this project I was working with a new project leader. We sat down and discussed the site's value proposition and map out key aspects of: what the site is, who are the users, and how the site will be used. We narrowed down our blueprint and created a consensus that this site should focus on unique branding to attract app developers and other potential clients. The site must be able to showcase a variety of illustrations and communicate key features and clear service flow.  Our primary KPI was to drive inquires and business leads.

## Iteration
Most of the site assets were already in our possession, so I decided to quickly mark up some moodboards and get an overall sense and direction. The project leader has some ideas and we bounced these around and came up with two distinct designs. We tested our wireframe prototypes and moved forward with two viable designs for a high fidelity mock.

## Implementation
I leveraged Gulp with the Foundation framework and implemented the sticky nav component to achieve maximum exposure for the header on first view. I exported my custom icons from Sketch and used Icomoon to read these in with CSS.

## Retrospective
Aim for the most unique experience you can through custom elements and hand drawn illustration. This was one of the rare projects where original artwork was sourced and custom icons were implemented.
