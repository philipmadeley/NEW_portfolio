## Overview
To design and develop two landing pages which instantly informs the user about key product features whilst providing appropriate call-to-action dialogue. The site must incorporate an integrated brand experience for both advertiser and publisher pages.

## Process & Involvement
* Wireframe + prototyping
* Art direction + branding
* Design + Front-end development

## Focus Point
Differentiate between the publisher and advertiser pages whilst maintaining a centralised brand experience and layout that is similar in both structure and rhythm.

## Focus Solution
Create two swatch palettes â€” the publisher UI veering towards more monochromatic tones and advertiser incorporating brighter more contrasting colours. Provide cohesion between iconography, typography, background motifs and imagery.
