## Overview
I worked with a small cross-functional team to craft custom advertising solutions for top-tier clients in Tokyo. Kao, a major cosmetics company, wanted to increase awareness of a new fabric softener (Dress and Airy), through a custom landing page experience.   

## Goals
Since the product was new to the market, Kao wanted to focus on two goals:
1. Create brand awareness and lift
2. Motivate the customer to buy the product

## Concept
We ran a design sprint and created a concept around the idea of synergy; two different products that interlinked in the middle. We posed the question - <i>which one are you, day or night?</i> The user could interact with both products and deepen their understanding through a video with additional product information below. Lastly, the product carousel provided the range of products sold on Amazon.

I worked with a talented visual designer to design flows and create assets, then prototyped the concept below in Framer.

## Final Campaign
After winning the pitch, we set up a list of checkpoints and worked with QA to ensure pixel perfection on the myriad of devices that needed to support any Amazon page. The final desktop version below shows all three views for the top slider. The default view is the middle image.

This execution covered all three form factors: desktop, tablet, and mobile. However, since leaving Amazon, I've been unable to obtain all the screenshots.
